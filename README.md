# fluid-react-starter

## Introduction to Repo

### Overview


This repo is a Fluid starter template that was created to answer the question "how do I create a Fluid app that is more complex than Hello World?" To answer this question this repo makes the following assumptions:

1. You want to use React for your view
2. You want to keep clear separation between your model and view
3. You want a light state management framework to remove the boilerplate needed to store, access and modify React app state

In the readme below we'll walk you through how to do the following:
### Using this repo

- Run the app locally
- Run the app against an FRS instance
- Deploy the app
- Repo structure overview

### Modifying the model

- Modify the schema to include additional DDSes
- Update the `defaultData` of those DDSes
- Update the `model` to access and modify your Fluid data
- Write custom events

### Modifying the view
- Modify the store
  - `initialState`
  - `queries`
  - `actions`
  - `reducer`
- Importing and using the store
  - Using `queries`
  - Dispatching `actions`
